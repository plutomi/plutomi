## How to contribute to Plutomi

#### **Did you find a bug?**

- **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead please email security@plutomi.com

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/plutomi/plutomi/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/plutomi/plutomi/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Plutomi will generally not be accepted. Typos fixes are ok! :D

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Suggest your change in an issue or discusstion and before you start writing code, we will get back to you to ensure this change is tied to the direction we want Plutomi to go in.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**
