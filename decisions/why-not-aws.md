### Why aren't you on AWS?

Plutomi WAS on AWS at one point!

I thought self hosting might be a good opportunity to learn more devops stuff, along with balancing costs and performance for what I wanted to do. At my current scale (0 users) this is fine for a long while. Since we are on Kubernetes now, it should be relatively easy to move to a cloud provider if needed.
