### Why K3S?

We wanted to gain experience with Kubernetes, but didn't want to deal with the complexity of a full Kubernetes cluster. Cost was also a big concern as development idle costs would have been a few hundred dollars a month on any of the major cloud providers.

K3S is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution that is easy to install and manage. It is also a CNCF certified Kubernetes distribution, so we can be confident that it is a good choice for our use case.
