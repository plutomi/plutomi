. Consumer Hierarchy:
Business Logic Consumers:

Process core events like TOTPRequested.
Have retries and DLQ handling, ensuring resilience if something goes wrong in the primary processing.
Meta Consumers:

Handle failures in the business logic consumers (via MAX_DELIVERIES advisories).
Have their own retries and DLQs, adding another layer of fault tolerance.
Super-Meta Consumers:

Handle failures in the meta consumers, ensuring that even system-level events are robustly managed.
These consumers handle the edge cases where the meta handling itself fails, which is a critical part of making your system highly resilient. 2. Stream Design:
Events Stream: Holds the primary events like TOTPRequested.
Retry Stream: Catches events that need to be retried after a failure.
DLQ Stream: Stores events that failed even after retries, ensuring they donâ€™t get lost. 3. Error Handling:
Retries: Each consumer layer (business, meta, and super-meta) has a retry mechanism to handle transient errors.
DLQs: Each consumer layer also has a DLQ to catch and log persistent failures, ensuring no message is lost.

You're using NATS JetStream to create an event streaming system with retry and dead-letter queue (DLQ) functionality.
You have three main streams:

"events": for primary event processing
"events-retry": for retrying failed events
"events-dlq": for events that have failed all retry attempts

You have two types of consumers:
a. Meta consumers: These handle system advisory messages, particularly MAX_DELIVERIES events.
b. Business logic consumers: These handle actual business events (e.g., TOTPRequested).
The meta consumers are responsible for:

Monitoring MAX_DELIVERIES events for business logic consumers
Moving failed events to the appropriate retry or DLQ streams
Handling their own failure cases (meta-consumer-retry and meta-consumer-dlq)

The business logic consumers (e.g., notifications-consumer) process actual events like TOTPRequested.
You've implemented a waterfall retry mechanism:

If a business logic consumer fails, it's picked up by a meta-consumer
The meta-consumer moves it to the retry stream
If it fails in the retry stream, it's moved to the DLQ stream

NOTE: important
retry and DLQ streams never get a duplicate copy of a message, instead they get a pointer (the max delivery event) and then lookup the message in the main stream.

FINAL:


and claude:
Overview:
This pipeline implements a robust event-driven architecture using NATS JetStream for handling various events in a SaaS application. It's designed to process events reliably, with built-in retry mechanisms and dead-letter queues (DLQ) for handling failures.
Key Components:

Streams:

Three main streams: "events", "events-retry", and "events-dlq"
Each stream handles different stages of event processing

Consumers:

Multiple consumers are defined for different purposes:
a. Business logic consumers (e.g., "notifications-consumer")
b. Meta consumers for handling system advisories (e.g., "meta-consumer")
c. Retry and DLQ consumers for error handling

Event Types:

Currently handles TOTPRequested events, but extensible for other event types

Error Handling:

Implements a sophisticated retry and DLQ system
Uses NATS JetStream's MAX_DELIVERIES advisory to manage retries

Logging:

Comprehensive logging throughout the pipeline for monitoring and debugging

Pipeline Flow:

Event Publication:

Events are published to the "events" stream

Primary Processing:

Business logic consumers (e.g., "notifications-consumer") process events from the "events" stream
If processing fails, NATS generates a MAX_DELIVERIES advisory

Retry Mechanism:

Meta consumers capture MAX_DELIVERIES advisories
Failed events are republished to the "events-retry" stream
Retry consumers attempt to process the event again

Dead Letter Queue:

If retries fail, events are moved to the "events-dlq" stream
DLQ consumers handle these events (e.g., for manual intervention or logging)

Meta-Consumer Error Handling:

The system also handles failures in meta-consumers themselves
Implements a "super-meta-consumer" system for handling meta-consumer failures

Key Features:

Resilience: Multiple layers of retry and error handling ensure no events are lost
Scalability: Separate consumers for different event types allow for independent scaling
Observability: Extensive logging provides insights into the system's operation
Flexibility: The structure allows easy addition of new event types and consumers

Implementation Details:

Uses Rust with async programming model
Leverages NATS JetStream features like durable consumers and filtered subjects
Implements custom error handling and advisory message processing
Uses a configuration-driven approach for defining streams and consumers

This pipeline provides a robust foundation for event-driven architectures, ensuring reliable processing of events with sophisticated error handling and observability. It's particularly well-suited for SaaS applications that require high reliability and scalability in event processing.
