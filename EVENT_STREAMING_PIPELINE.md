### Event Streaming Pipeline Overview

The Plutomi NATS JetStream event streaming pipeline is a robust, event-driven architecture designed to handle various events reliably and efficiently within the Plutomi SaaS application. Leveraging NATS JetStream, this pipeline ensures that events are processed with built-in retry mechanisms, dead-letter queues (DLQ), and extensive logging for resilience, scalability, and observability.

Key Components:
Streams:

The pipeline defines three main streams: events, events-retry, and events-dlq.
Each stream represents different stages of event processing:
Events: The primary stream where events are first published.
Events-Retry: Handles retrying failed events.
Events-DLQ: A final destination for events that fail to process after multiple attempts.
Consumers:

Business Logic Consumers: Handle the core application events (e.g., notifications-consumer for processing notification events like sending TOTP emails).
Meta Consumers: These consumers handle system-level advisories, particularly MAX_DELIVERIES advisories when events fail to process after a maximum number of attempts.
Super-Meta-Consumers: An additional layer to manage failures within meta-consumers themselves. They ensure that even meta-consumer failures are handled by retrying them or moving them to their respective DLQ streams.
Event Types:

The system currently handles events like TOTPRequested but is designed to be extensible for other event types as the application evolves.
Error Handling:

The pipeline implements a sophisticated error handling mechanism using NATS JetStream’s MAX_DELIVERIES advisory to manage retries.
If an event fails to process, it’s moved through a sequence of retry attempts. If all retries fail, the event is sent to the events-dlq stream for manual intervention or further logging.
Note: The retry and DLQ handlers do not receive a direct copy of the original message. Instead, they look up the original message in the events stream based on information provided in the MAX_DELIVERIES advisory. This ensures that the exact original event data is used consistently across retries and error handling.
Logging:

Comprehensive logging is integrated throughout the pipeline to provide visibility into event processing, error handling, and system health. Logs capture everything from successful event handling to retry attempts and final DLQ placements.
Pipeline Flow:
Event Publication:

Events are published into the events stream, which acts as the entry point for the pipeline.
Primary Processing:

Business logic consumers process these events from the events stream. If an event fails to be processed, NATS generates a MAX_DELIVERIES advisory.
Retry Mechanism:

Meta-consumers capture these MAX_DELIVERIES advisories and republish the failed events to the events-retry stream.
Retry consumers then attempt to process the event again. This retry mechanism ensures that transient issues do not result in permanent data loss.
Dead Letter Queue (DLQ):

If all retry attempts fail, events are moved to the events-dlq stream.
DLQ consumers handle these final-stage events, often involving manual review or triggering alerts for further investigation.
Meta-Consumer Error Handling:

Super-meta-consumers are in place to handle failures within the meta-consumers. If a meta-consumer itself fails (e.g., fails to handle a MAX_DELIVERIES advisory), the super-meta-consumer will manage the retries and escalate to the DLQ if necessary.
Key Features:
Resilience: The pipeline’s multi-layered error handling ensures that no event is lost, and the system remains operational even under failure conditions.
Scalability: By separating consumers for different event types, the system can scale each component independently according to load.
Observability: Extensive logging throughout the pipeline provides deep insights into event flows, processing status, and error handling, making it easier to monitor and debug.
Flexibility: The structure is highly configurable, allowing for easy addition of new event types and consumers as the application grows.
Implementation Details:
The pipeline is implemented in Rust, utilizing an asynchronous programming model for high performance.
It leverages NATS JetStream features like durable consumers and filtered subjects, which provide fine-grained control over message processing.
Custom error handling and advisory message processing are integrated to ensure robustness.
The system is configuration-driven, allowing easy adjustments to streams, consumers, and their behaviors without modifying the core codebase.

. Consumer Hierarchy:
Business Logic Consumers:

Process core events like TOTPRequested.
Have retries and DLQ handling, ensuring resilience if something goes wrong in the primary processing.
Meta Consumers:

Handle failures in the business logic consumers (via MAX_DELIVERIES advisories).
Have their own retries and DLQs, adding another layer of fault tolerance.
Super-Meta Consumers:

Handle failures in the meta consumers, ensuring that even system-level events are robustly managed.
These consumers handle the edge cases where the meta handling itself fails, which is a critical part of making your system highly resilient. 2. Stream Design:
Events Stream: Holds the primary events like TOTPRequested.
Retry Stream: Catches events that need to be retried after a failure.
DLQ Stream: Stores events that failed even after retries, ensuring they don’t get lost. 3. Error Handling:
Retries: Each consumer layer (business, meta, and super-meta) has a retry mechanism to handle transient errors.
DLQs: Each consumer layer also has a DLQ to catch and log persistent failures, ensuring no message is lost.

Certainly! Based on the code you've provided, here's an overview of what's happening in your event streaming pipeline:

You're using NATS JetStream to create an event streaming system with retry and dead-letter queue (DLQ) functionality.
You have three main streams:

"events": for primary event processing
"events-retry": for retrying failed events
"events-dlq": for events that have failed all retry attempts

You have two types of consumers:
a. Meta consumers: These handle system advisory messages, particularly MAX_DELIVERIES events.
b. Business logic consumers: These handle actual business events (e.g., TOTPRequested).
The meta consumers are responsible for:

Monitoring MAX_DELIVERIES events for business logic consumers
Moving failed events to the appropriate retry or DLQ streams
Handling their own failure cases (meta-consumer-retry and meta-consumer-dlq)

The business logic consumers (e.g., notifications-consumer) process actual events like TOTPRequested.
You've implemented a waterfall retry mechanism:

If a business logic consumer fails, it's picked up by a meta-consumer
The meta-consumer moves it to the retry stream
If it fails in the retry stream, it's moved to the DLQ stream

NOTE: important
retry and DLQ streams never get a duplicate copy of a message, instead they get a pointer (the max delivery event) and then lookup the message in the main stream.
