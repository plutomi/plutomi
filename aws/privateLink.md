In the future, if we go back to AWS, we'll connect to the DB using [Private Link](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-private-endpoint/). During our testing, we noticed a [~15-30% drop in latency](https://twitter.com/notjoswayski/status/1685539187158614017?s=20) when using Private Link vs the public endpoint. You're going to want to deploy to AWS first connecting with your regular public endpoint so you can have your VPC & subnets, create the endpoint on MongoDB's end, then redeploy with the new URI MongoDB gives you. Make sure to follow all the steps on that page, especially the last one (allowing the newly created endpoint to have inbound access from your instances security group). Im leaving this here as a future note :)
