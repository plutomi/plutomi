# Plutomi

Plutomi is a _multi-tenant_ [applicant tracking system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system) that streamlines your entire application process with automated workflows at any scale.

## Motivation

Having worked at a company that needed to recruit thousands of contractors every month, improving our acquisition flow at that scale became a challenge. Many processes had to be done manually because there just wasn't an API available for it. We often hit limits and had to work around them with a myriad of webhooks, queues, and batch jobs to keep things running smoothly. It would have benefited us to have an open platform to contribute to and build upon and this project is [my](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joswayski/) attempt to do just that.

## Summary

You can create `applications` which people can apply to. An application can be anything from a job, a location for a delivery company, or a program like a summer camp.

In these applications, you can create `stages` which are individual steps that need to be completed by your `applicants`. You can add `questions` and setup automatic move `rules` that determine where applicants go next depending on their `responses` or after a certain time period.

An application for a delivery company might look like this:

**New York City**

Stages:

1. **Questionnaire** - Collect basic information of an applicant. If an applicant does not complete this stage in 30 days, move them to the _Waiting List_.
2. **Waiting List** - An idle pool of applicants
3. **Document Upload** - Collect an applicant's license
4. **Final Review** - Manually review an applicant's license for compliance
5. **Ready to Drive** - Applicants that have completed your application

## Prerequisites

- [Node 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [AWS CDK CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install) and [SSO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html)

## Infra

Plutomi is deployed to AWS using [CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/). A couple of resources are created like a [Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) service which runs the [web app](/packages/web) (NextJS) and [api](/packages/api/) (Rust with Axum) in a private subnet as well as a NAT instance using [fck-nat](https://fck-nat.dev/) for outbound traffic. We use [SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) for sending emails and have an event processing pipeline to handle things like opens, clicks, bounces, etc. We use Cloudflare for DNS, CDN, WAF and other goodies - make sure to add a [Cache Rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/cache-rules/) to ignore `/api` routes.

For the database, we are using [MongoDB on Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) where we store everything in one collection. We write small documents and index a `relatedTo` attribute that is shared across all items. For most queries, we can get an item and all of the items it is related to without using `$lookup`. You can check [this video](https://youtu.be/eEENrNKxCdw?t=1190) for a demonstration of this technique.

### Running Locally

The following will start the API and the web app in development mode:

```bash
$ scripts/run.sh
```

You can also run either individually:

```bash
$ scripts/run.sh --stack <web|api>
```

The script also has hot reloading for both so you can make changes and see them reflected immediately once you save the file.

### Deploying

To deploy to AWS, make sure you have [configured SSO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html) correctly. Update the `AWS_PROFILE` variable in [deploy.sh](deploy.sh) to match the profile names you want to use. Update the subdomain you want to use for sending emails in [configureEmails.ts](./packages/aws/lib/configureEmails.ts).

Change directories into `packages/aws`, install dependencies, and set up the environment-specific `.env` files and modify the values as needed.

```bash
$ cd packages/aws
$ npm install
$ cp .env.sample .env.development
$ cp .env.sample .env.staging
$ cp .env.sample .env.production
```

Once that's done, you can go back to the root and deploy using `scripts/deploy.sh <development|staging|production>`.

![SES DNS Records](./images/ses-setup.png)

Also, make sure to setup DMARC. This is a TXT record with the name `_dmarc.yourMAILFROMdomain.com` and value `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:you@adomainwhereyoucanreceiveemails.com`
See [this link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-authentication-dmarc.html) for more information.

In MongoDB, make sure to whitelist the IP address of the NAT instance which you can find in the EC2 console. We will eventually migrate over to use [PrivateLink](packages/aws/privateLink.md).
