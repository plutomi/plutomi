# Plutomi

Plutomi is a _multi-tenant_ [applicant tracking system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system) that streamlines your entire application process with automated workflows at any scale.

## Motivation

Having worked at a company that needed to recruit thousands of contractors every month, improving our acquisition flow at that scale became a challenge. Many processes had to be done manually because there just wasn't an API available for it. We often hit limits and had to work around them with a myriad of webhooks, queues, and batch jobs to keep things running smoothly. It would have benefited us to have an open platform to contribute to and build upon and this project is [my](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joswayski/) attempt to do just that.

## Summary

You can create `applications` which people can apply to. An application can be anything from a job, a location for a delivery company, or a program like a summer camp.

In these applications, you can create `stages` which are individual steps that need to be completed by your `applicants`. You can add `questions` and setup automatic move `rules` that determine where applicants go next depending on their `responses` or after a certain time period.

An application for a delivery company might look like this:

**New York City**

Stages:

1. **Questionnaire** - Collect basic information of an applicant. If an applicant does not complete this stage in 30 days, move them to the _Waiting List_.
2. **Waiting List** - An idle pool of applicants
3. **Document Upload** - Collect an applicant's license
4. **Final Review** - Manually review an applicant's license for compliance
5. **Ready to Drive** - Applicants that have completed your application

## Prerequisites

- [Node 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [AWS CDK CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install) and [SSO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [fly.io CLI](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/)

## Infra

The NextJS app and API are deployed to [fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/speedrun/) using Docker. The NextJS app forwards all API requests through the internal Fly network to the API. The API is not exposed to the public internet. As of this writing, it's a basic Rust server using [Axum](https://crates.io/crates/axum). I wanted to learn Rust and this seemed like a good project to do that with. If you see something that can be improved, please open a PR! ü¶Ä

We are using MongoDB on [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) where we store everything in one collection. We write small documents and index a `relatedTo` attribute that is shared across all items. For most queries, we can get an item and all of the items it is related to without using `$lookup`. You can check [this video](https://youtu.be/eEENrNKxCdw?t=1190) for a demonstration of this technique.

#### API Networking

To make sure that the API is not exposed to the public internet, you can run `fly ips list` and `fly ips release <ip>` for both ipv4 and ipv6 that is returned. Then, allocate a private ipv6 with `fly ips allocate-v6 --private`. You can verify that the API is not exposed by running `fly ips list` and ensuring only the ipv6 address is listed and it is private.

## Useful Scripts

### Running Locally

The following will start the API and the frontend in development mode:

```bash
$ scripts/run.sh
```

You can also run either individually:

```bash
$ scripts/run.sh --stack <web|api>
```

The script also has hot reloading for both so you can make changes and see them reflected immediately once you save the file.

### Deploying

```bash
$ scripts/deploy.sh --stack <web|api|aws> --env <staging|production>
```

An environment of `development` will work with AWS **only** as it is meant to give you the resources needed when running the other things locally.

If you omit a stack, all of them will be deployed. If you omit an environment, `staging` will be used.

## AWS

To deploy to AWS, make sure you have [configured SSO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html) correctly. Update the `AWS_PROFILE` variable in [deploy.sh](deploy.sh) to match the profile names you want to use. Update the domains you want to use in [setupSES.ts](./packages/aws/lib/setupSES.ts).

After running the deploy script above, most of your environment will be setup. For SES, you'll need to add a few records to your DNS provider. Your SES dashboard should look something like this with the records you need to add:

![SES DNS Records](./images/ses-setup.png)

Also, you'll want to add a DMARC record to your DNS provider. This is a TXT record with the name `_dmarc.yourMAILFROMdomain.com` and value `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:you@adomainwhereyoucanreceiveemails.com`
See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-authentication-dmarc.html) for more information.
