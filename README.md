# Plutomi

Plutomi is a _multi-tenant_ [applicant tracking system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system) that streamlines your entire application process with automated workflows.

## Motivation

Having worked at a company that needed to recruit thousands of contractors every month, improving our acquisition flow at that scale became a challenge. Many processes had to be done manually because there just wasn't an API available for it. We often hit limits and had to work around them with a myriad of webhooks, queues, and batch jobs to keep things running smoothly. It would have benefited us to have an open platform to contribute to and build upon and this project is [my](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joswayski/) attempt to do just that.

## Summary

You can create `applications` which people can apply to. An application can be anything from a job, a location for a delivery company, or a program like a summer camp.git

In these applications, you can create `stages` which are individual steps that need to be completed by your `applicants`. You can add `questions` and setup automatic move `rules` that determine where applicants go next depending on their `responses` or after a certain time period.

An application for a delivery company might look like this:

**New York City**

Stages:
TOD0: Install helm

````
brew install helm OR curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```


1. **Questionnaire** - Collect basic information of an applicant. If an applicant does not complete this stage in 30 days, move them to the _Waiting List_.
2. **Waiting List** - An idle pool of applicants
3. **Document Upload** - Collect an applicant's license
4. **Final Review** - Manually review an applicant's license for compliance
5. **Ready to Drive** - Applicants that have completed your application

## Prerequisites

- [Node 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [AWS CDK CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install) and [SSO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html)

<!--TODO See if we can get hetzner referral link :') -->

## Infra

# See the k8s directory for the k8s setup

Plutomi is deployed using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to any VPS you can get your hands on (we recommend [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/)). The frontend is a [Remix](https://remix.run/) app and the API is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) framework. We use [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) as a reverse proxy to forward traffic to those containers appropriately. We use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for our database and try to follow patterns like [this](https://youtu.be/IYlWOk9Hu5g?t=1094) where we store everything in a single collection.

We use [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) to deploy a couple of resources like setting up [SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) for emails, [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) to receive email events like opens, clicks, bounces, etc., and a [queue](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) to put those events in, along with custom app events like `totp.requested`, `invite.sent`, or `application.submitted`.

We also use Cloudflare for DNS, CDN, WAF and other goodies, and log with Prometheus and Grafana.

<!-- To be implemented later
 and eventually, storage using [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) and [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/). -->

<!-- To be implemented later
We also use [Redis](https://redis.io/) for caching / rate limiting. -->

<!-- We use Meli/Elastic/Typesense for search. -->

## TODO to build api for Mac -> Ubuntu linux docker build -. -t plutomi/api --platform linux/amd64

```bash

docker buildx create --name multiarch --use --bootstrap


docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t plutomi/<api|web> . --push
--push
````

### Also building might take a long time, you might want to use --watch instead in dev mode

### Running Locally

## TODO make anote about not running the API locally in docker because it takes too long?

The following will start the API and the web app in development mode:

// document no rollback https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/1993rph/problems_with_complex_deployments_and_how_cdkcf/

```bash
$ scripts/run.sh
```

You can also run either individually:

```bash
$ scripts/run.sh --stack <web|api>
```

The script also has hot reloading for both so you can make changes and see them reflected immediately once you change and save a file. Update the `.env` in `packages/<api|web>`for any environment variables needed.

When running locally, due to Docker, watch, and rust compile times, we recommend running API and Web app on their own outside of docker. Keep Nginx, Keep database and redis since these won't need to change often if at all. m2 max taking a few minutes to build API from scratch, granted this is cross platform from arm -> amd64

### Deploying

To deploy Plutomi, you'll want to deploy to AWS first and then use `docker-compose` on your server. The plutomi imges can be found on DockerHub as well. Check out [DEPLOYING.md](DEPLOYING.md) for more information.
