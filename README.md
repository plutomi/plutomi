# Plutomi

Plutomi is a _multi-tenant_ [applicant tracking system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system) that streamlines your entire application process with automated workflows at any scale.

## Motivation

Having worked at a company that needed to recruit thousands of contractors every month, improving our acquisition flow at that scale became a challenge. Many processes had to be done manually because there just wasn't an API available for it. We often hit limits and had to work around them with a myriad of webhooks, queues, and batch jobs to keep things running smoothly. It would have benefited us to have an open platform to contribute to and build upon and this project is [my](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joswayski/) attempt to do just that.

## Summary

You can create `applications` which people can apply to. An application can be anything from a job, a location for a delivery company, or a program like a summer camp.

In these applications, you can create `stages` which are individual steps that need to be completed by your `applicants`. You can add `questions` and setup automatic move `rules` that determine where applicants go next depending on their `responses` or after a certain time period.

An application for a delivery company might look like this:

**New York City**

Stages:

1. **Questionnaire** - Collect basic information of an applicant. If an applicant does not complete this stage in 30 days, move them to the _Waiting List_.
2. **Waiting List** - An idle pool of applicants
3. **Document Upload** - Collect an applicant's license
4. **Final Review** - Manually review an applicant's license for compliance
5. **Ready to Drive** - Applicants that have completed your application

## Prerequisites

- [Node 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [AWS CDK CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install)
- [AWS SSO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html)

- [SES identity](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home?region=us-east-1#/get-set-up) for sending emails
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [fly.io CLI](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/)

## Useful Scripts

### Running Locally

The following will start the API and the frontend in development mode:

```bash
$ scripts/run.sh
```

You can also run either individually:

```bash
$ scripts/run.sh <api|web>
```

The script also has hot reloading for both so you can make changes and see them reflected immediately once you save the file.

### Deploying

```bash
$ scripts/deploy.sh <api|web> <staging|production>
```

Ensure that the `main` branch is set for your production environment on Cloudflare Pages and everything should work.

## Website & API

The frontend is deployed to [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-nextjs-site/). Any SSR pages use a Cloudflare Worker to proxy the request to the API and send the response back to the client.

The API is deployed to [fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/speedrun/) using Docker.
There's honestly not much to say here as of this writing, it's a basic Rust server using [Axum](https://crates.io/crates/axum). I wanted to learn a bit of Rust and this seemed like a good project to do that with. I'm not a Rust expert, so if you see something that can be improved, please open a PR! ü¶Ä

## AWS

To deploy to AWS, make sure you have [configured SSO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html) correctly. Update the `AWS_PROFILE` variable in [deploy.sh](deploy.sh) to match the profile names you want to use. Update the domains you want to use in [setupSES.ts](./packages/aws/lib/setupSES.ts).

After running the deploy script above, most of your environment will be setup. For SES, you'll need to add a few records to your DNS provider. Your SES dashboard should look something like this with the records you need to add:

![SES DNS Records](./images/ses-setup.png)

Also, you'll want to add a DMARC record to your DNS provider. This is a TXT record with the name `_dmarc.yourMAILFROMdomain.com` and value `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:you@adomainwhereyoucanreceiveemails.com`
See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-authentication-dmarc.html) for more information.

## Database

We are using MongoDB on [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) where we store everything in one collection ([yes, really](https://youtu.be/eEENrNKxCdw?t=1190)). We write small documents and index a `relatedTo` attribute that is shared across all items. For most queries, we can get an item and all of the items it is related to without using `$lookup`. See the example below with an applicant and their notes and files:

```typescript
const applicant = {
  name: "Jose Valerio",
  nickname: "joswayski",
  company: "Plutomi, Inc.",
  relatedTo: [
    {
      id: "applicant_123",
      type: "self", // Every item has a reference to itself
    },
  ],
};

const note = {
  text: "This applicant is great!",
  createdBy: "Random Hiring Manager",
  relatedTo: [
    {
      id: "note_123",
      type: "self", /
    },
    {
      id: "applicant_123", // Reference to the applicant
      type: "note",
    },
  ],
};

const file = {
  name: "resume.pdf",
  url: "https://assets.plutomi.com/resume.pdf",
  relatedTo: [
    {
      id: "file_123",
      type: "file",
    }
    {
      id: "applicant_123", // Reference to the applicant
      type: "file",
    },
  ],
};


const applicantWithNotesAndFiles = db.find({ relatedTo: { $elemMatch: { id: "applicant_123" } } });
const justTheNotesForThisApplicant = db.find({ relatedTo: { $elemMatch: { id: "applicant_123", type: "notes" } } });


```
