### [Website](https://plutomi.com)

**Plutomi is an applicant tracking system**.

You can create `openings`, which people can apply to. An opening can be anything from a job, a location for a delivery company, or a program like a summer camp.

In these openings, you can create `stages` which are individual steps for your application. You can add questions which applicants can answer, and setup automatic move rules that determine where applicants go next depending on their answers or after a certain time period.

An _opening_ for a delivery company might look like this:

Opening name: **New York City**

Stage order:

1. **Questionnaire** - Collect basic information of an applicant. If an applicant does not complete this stage in 30 days, move them to the _Waiting List_.
2. **Waiting List** - An idle pool of applicants
3. **Document Upload** - Collect an applicant's license
4. **Final Review** - Manually review an applicant's license for compliance
5. **Ready to Drive** - Applicants that have completed your application

## Tooling

We believe CDK to be the future and it's nice to have 'first-class' tooling directly from AWS. Therefore,
**all infrastructure is managed by CDK**.

## Infrastructure

We _started_ with the [Serverless-Nextjs](https://github.com/serverless-nextjs/serverless-next.js) component which uses Lambda@Edge for API routes. There are many downsides to Edge functions, some are listed [here](https://github.com/plutomi/plutomi/issues/172). We've since moved on to hosting entirely on AWS Fargate.

As much as we love "serverless" (API Gateway + Lambda), we keep running into quirks that essentially wipe out all of the gains from "only focusing on business logic". A main complaint is local development. The only real way to test lambda functions locally is to use [AWS SAM with CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/better-together-aws-sam-and-aws-cdk/) which just seems like a hack :/.
With CDK, we can run Nextjs in Docker and use the native Nextjs dev environment, tooling, & file based routing and not have to change anything. [This comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28841292) on Hacker News also adds some insight.

Here is a fun (4 year old) bug: [Unable to change parameter name in API Gateway without tearing it all down and rebuilding](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/3785)! Because why would you ever need to do that?

Or [cold starts](https://filia-aleks.medium.com/aws-lambda-battle-2021-performance-comparison-for-all-languages-c1b441005fd1) / [performance](https://www.trek10.com/blog/fargate-vs-lambda) / cost (either way you slice this one: pure throughput or just Denial of Wallet attacks). To be clear, we will still use lambda for background tasks such as queues, DynamoDB streams, email sending, etc. just not for the main API of the site.

Some other useful repos:

- [AWS ECS Patterns](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/tree/master/packages/%40aws-cdk/aws-ecs-patterns)
- [Serverless CDK Patterns](https://github.com/cdk-patterns/serverless)

## Useful commands

> NOTE: To deploy, you must first build your docker image and publish to ECR. We will automate this via CI / CD in the future.
>
> `docker build -t <your-username>:<your-app-name> .`
>
> [How to push your image to ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/docker-push-ecr-image.html)

- `npm run dev` run the app locally
- `cdk deploy` deploy the site
- `cdk destroy` destroy the site
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
